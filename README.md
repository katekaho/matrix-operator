# Matrix Operator #

This program take two matrices the user inputs and performs operations on them. 

It works by taking advantage of sparse matrices to perform faster calculations.

## Operations include ##
* Multiply
	* Multiplies two matrices
* Scalar Multiply
	* Multiplies a matrix by any scalar number
* Add
	* Adds two matrices
* Subtract
	* Subtracts a matrix from another
* Transpose
	* Transposes the matrix
